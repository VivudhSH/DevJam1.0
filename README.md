# DevJam1.0
Under this project I have created an android application in which the person in need of blood under any circumstance will be able to contact people/hospitals for help.
The quick access to help is the key feature here. On a click of button your contacts will be alerted and then you don't have to take the stress in contacting them in such critical situation.
Just one click and 1000+ contacts will be informed which blood group you want along with giving you location of near-by hospitals.
